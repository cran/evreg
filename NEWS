Package: evreg
Title: Evidential Regression

Changes in version 1.0.1 

* Correction of a bug in function "predict.ENNreg" that caused an error when the test set had only one instance.
* The cross-validation subsets are sampled differently in function "ENNreg.cv" to avoid empty subsets when the initial sample is small.
* Correction of typos in the documentation.
